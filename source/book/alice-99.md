### Epigraph

## All in the Golden Afternoon

> All in the golden afternoon <br>
> Full leisurely we glide; <br>
> For both our oars, with little skill, <br>
> By little arms are plied; <br>
> While little hands make vain pretence <br>
> Our wanderings to guide.
>
> Ah, cruel Three! In such an hour, <br>
> Beneath such dreamy weather, <br>
> To beg a tale of breath too weak<br>
> To stir the tiniest feather! <br>
> Yet what can one poor voice avail <br>
> Against three tongues together?
>
> Imperious Prima flashes forth <br>
> Her edict “to begin it”: <br>
> In gentler tones Secunda hopes <br>
> “There will be nonsense in it.” <br>
> While Tertia interrupts the tale <br>
> Not _more_ than once a minute.
>
> Anon, to sudden silence won, <br>
> In fancy they pursue <br>
> The dream-child moving through a land <br>
> Of wonders wild and new, <br>
> In friendly chat with bird or beast⁠ — <br>
> And half believe it true.
>
> And ever, as the story drained <br>
> The wells of fancy dry, <br>
> And faintly strove that weary one <br>
> To put the subject by, <br>
> “The rest next time⁠—” “It _is_ next time!” <br>
> The happy voices cry.
>
> Thus grew the tale of Wonderland: <br>
> Thus slowly, one by one, <br>
> Its quaint events were hammered out⁠ — <br>
> And now the tale is done, <br>
> And home we steer, a merry crew, <br>
> Beneath the setting sun.
>
> Alice! A childish story take, <br>
> And with a gentle hand <br>
> Lay it where Childhood’s dreams are twined <br>
> In Memory’s mystic band, <br>
> Like pilgrim’s withered wreath of flowers <br>
> Pluck’d in a far-off land.
